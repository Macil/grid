# @macil/grid [![JSR](https://jsr.io/badges/@macil/grid)](https://jsr.io/@macil/grid)

This library contains implementations of discrete 2D grid data structures and
tools for working with them in TypeScript.

This library was originally developed for use in solutions to
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenges, but may be
useful in other contexts as well.

The set of types in this library is inspired by the Rust library
[gridly](https://github.com/Lucretiel/gridly-rs).
